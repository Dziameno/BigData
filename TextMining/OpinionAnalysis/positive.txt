Best hotel to stay in! It holds it's great standard from the beginning. management does not do any "money saving action" through cutting the amazing breakfast! Breakfast is exceptionell and has everything you would want! Best are the pancakes with cheese and strawberry sauce! If you go close to 11am you can get everything you want or order with the staff.The staff is very nice and will take care of everything you need.I have traveled in 60 countries worldwide and even stayed at the Burj al Arab... but Przystan is still my absolutely favourite hotel :)When it is fully booked it can get to crowded at breakfast and the guests sometimes are not on their best behaviour. But that's not the hotels fault and complaining on a very high level :)

staff at the restaurant was rude and behaved like they couldn’t be bothered (we waited for our drinks for 20 mins)staff at reception desk is hit and miss. On arrival lovely smiley lady warmly welcomed us but when we were leaving rude woman didn’t even asked how was our staydon’t really get why there is need of pre-authorisation of 200 PLN to open bill for the duration of the stay. Is there assumption that hotel guests can’t be trusted? We were quite in shock when wanted to charge diner to our room bill but was told we need to arrange it in reception.really poor bed quality - pillows practically didn’t exist and mattress was one of the cheapest ones. We woke up every day with backachegym could be bigger
